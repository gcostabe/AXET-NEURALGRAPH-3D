# AGENT CONTEXT RECOVERY PROTOCOL

## FUNDAMENTAL RULE

Recovery is not execution.

Recovering previous context does not automatically authorize previous work.

---

## CASE A — MEMORY LOSS DURING CURRENT EXECUTION

If context is lost while actively executing a user-authorized task:

1. Read `.agent/current_task.md`.
2. Read the latest relevant checkpoint from `.agent/execution_journal.md`.
3. Inspect relevant source files.
4. Determine the last safe checkpoint.
5. Resume from `Next Safe Action`.

Do not repeat completed work.

---

## CASE B — NEW CHAT

A new chat does NOT authorize continuation.

Wait for the user's current message.

Classify it.

- If NEW_TASK: follow the new task.
- If CONTINUE_TASK: recover current_task.
- If INFORMATIONAL: answer only the current request.

---

## CASE C — AMBIGUOUS MEMORY

If uncertain whether work was completed:

1. Check current_task.
2. Check execution journal.
3. Check source code.
4. Prefer implementation evidence.

Never guess.

---

## CASE D — STALE MEMORY

If memory disagrees with implementation: source code wins. Correct persistent memory.

---

## RECOVERY ORDER

1. current_task.md
2. latest relevant execution_journal checkpoint
3. relevant source files
4. state.md
5. decisions.md
6. stack_tech.md
7. selective history

---

## TRANSACTIONAL RECOVERY

If there is a checkpoint with `State: BEFORE_ACTION` but no matching `State: AFTER_ACTION` for the same action:

Do not presume the action occurred. Verify the actual file/state. Then register a recovery checkpoint:

```md
State: RECOVERY

Expected Previous Action:

Observed Actual State:

Conclusion:

Next Safe Action:
```

---

## ABSOLUTE RULE

Never ask the user to repeat project context before attempting recovery from persistent memory.

Never execute historical work solely because it exists in memory.
